## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

As parents paying more attention on their children's education, choosing the right school for their children has become one of the most concerned issues for parents. The school choosing process involves a variety of factors, including student age, gender, and school location, etc. These factors can make people waste a lot of time to mach and compare. This system is created to solve these problems.

This project used KIE Drools as rule engine. We analyzed some entry requirements of few schools, translates them into rules and built this simplified decision-making process to help parents/students and consultants get the most appropriate admission advice. With  the system's help, parents and students can find more suitable school using less time.

There are many conditions that affect the outcome of a school choosing decision process. This system only selects some as rule. But thanks to the flexibility and scalability of Drools,it is very easy to modify and add rules in the future.
